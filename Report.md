### Mini-Project Report

The mini-project overall was self explanatory. There wasn't really any major issues for our team when we worked on it together. I felt that there were some confusion in the project directions, and that the instructions could've been more clear. One instance was that there wasn't an alternative for people that didn't have an ethernet cable to connect to the wifi. Another example was that the way in which the project should be uploaded wasn't told until a couple days before the mini project was due. There were just a couple small directional issues that could've been stated more explicitly when the assignment was first assigned.

One other thing about the mini-project was that for the data collected it was less that 15+ minutes so that could somewhat impact the accuracy of the information that was collected. The trend that was being observed was who using wifi in the lab room. The main reason why that the data is less than 15+ minute is probably because the number of times it was ask to scan was 100. The duration of the data collected would probably be much longer had we changed the number of scans to 150 or 200.

In conclusion, the mini-project was a good way of letting the students get a feel for what a raspberry pi is, and understanding some of the basic mechanics behind how it works. It was an interesting, and not too challenging project that allowed the students to get an idea for what the raspberry pi can do.
