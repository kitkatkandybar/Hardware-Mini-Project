# Hardware-Mini-Project
### Senior Design Mini-Project by Kakit Wong and Hannah Gold

Fall 2021 ECE Senior Capstone Mini-project

The hardware mini-project allows students to interact with the Raspberry Pi hardware and operating system(Raspberry Pi OS) in order to develop a fundamental understanding of the functions of a single board computer. It also provides students with an opportunity to gain familarity with Python and embedded sensors that is accessed through the Raspberry Pi OS. Lastly, students are to collect and plot the data through the wireless sensor in the Raspberry Pi.

The mini-project overall was self explanatory. There wasn't really any major issues for our team when we worked on it together. I felt that there were some confusion in the project directions, and that the instructions could've been more clear. One instance was that there wasn't an alternative for people that does not have ethernet cables to connect to the wifi. Another example was that the way in which the project should be uploaded wasn't told until a couple days before the mini project was due. There were just a lot of minior
